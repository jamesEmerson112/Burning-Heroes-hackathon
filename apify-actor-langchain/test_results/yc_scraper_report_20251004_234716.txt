SHORT DESCRIPTION:
  Rippling for Content Creators

LONG DESCRIPTION:
  The rapidly growing creator economy ($250B+) consists of millions of solo entrepreneurs still managing complex business finances with spreadsheets and a patchwork of disconnected tools. They face volatile multi-source income, unique business expenses, and daunting U.S. tax obligations: leading to significant stress, lost time, and missed financial opportunities.

Beluga Labs is building the financial operating system for these modern solopreneurs. Our platform starts with intelligent bookkeeping: we connect all their financial accounts, use AI to automatically categorize income and expenses, and assess their potential tax deductibility, giving creators a clear picture of their business finances and tax preparedness. This core solution, already actively used for expense management and tax Q&A, is the first step. We will rapidly expand to automate quarterly tax filing and payments, then provide integrated tools for S-corp formation and management, payroll, and benefits: truly becoming the 'Rippling for content creators.' Our success means creators save more money, reduce administrative burdens, and can confidently focus on their craft and growth within the creator economy.

  • Is Hiring: True

SHORT DESCRIPTION:
  USDC-Smart Neobank for Latinos.

LONG DESCRIPTION:
  We’re building Kontigo, a USDC Smart Neobank for Latinos in the U.S. and Latin America.

We launched our Peer-to-Peer onramp 20 days ago and we’ve already had $540k in deposits, 10k active users and a +300k waitlist. 

The founding team has built and scaled fintechs in Latam, and it’s ex-Venmo, Nubank, Rappi, MercadoLibre, Ualá, Platzi, and Yuno. 

We’re already backed by DST Global, Soma Capital, Pioneer Fund, Transpose + 10 YC alums.

Sending money to Latin America is just as painful as holding it due to the region's fragmentation into 33 countries with 39 different currencies. 

On one hand, cross-border payments to Latam are absurdly expensive (up to 20% per transaction). Conversely, over the past decade, currency depreciation across the region has become unsustainable. (some countries surpassing the trillion percent ). 

Kontigo solves this with a USDC global wallet & a BTC savings account. 

- Like Venmo, but on-USDC.
- Like Zelle, but for cross-border payments. No limits.
- Like Nubank & Revolut, but without inflationary currencies. Bitcoin-backed.

User wallets are connected to an AI-private banker on WhatsApp to execute international USDC transactions.

SHORT DESCRIPTION:
  AI Copilot for Architects

LONG DESCRIPTION:
  ArchiLabs is building an AI co-pilot for architecture. Instead of spending hours on tedious tasks, architects can 10x their design speed with simple AI prompts.

Brian and William met at Carnegie Mellon as engineers and separately had their own frustrating new construction experiences. Brian ran a tech-enabled homebuilding factory and found the design iteration process to be a massive bottleneck, while William built ground up homes in Texas and had a similar frustration. However, at the time, there wasn't an easy solution to the many pain points in the design process.

As AI reasoning models improve, Brian and William realized that there was a massive opportunity to fix the long-tail of frustrations and build a new construction design experience by fine tuning existing models, becoming bigger than Autodesk, the $60B company in the space.

With the U.S. needing 2,000 gigawatts of new power generation by 2035 for AI data centers and electrification, Astro unlocks development opportunities that traditional methods consistently miss.

  • Is Hiring: False

SHORT DESCRIPTION:
  The first platform where parents & kids can co-create AI cartoon shows

LONG DESCRIPTION:
  Pixley is revolutionizing early education. No more passive learning: lectures, worksheets, deskwork. Kids don’t just watch content – they create it. With Pixley, any drawing or picture becomes an animated character, and every episode is shaped by the child’s imagination.

On the flip side, parents have complete control over what their kids learn. They choose the academic or moral lesson each story teaches, making screen time both safe and educational. For the first time, children and parents have complete control of the media they consume.

We’re harnessing brand-new video gen technology that’s set to revolutionize how the world creates and learns. Generating animated, narrative-consistent content from a child’s input in real time demands breakthroughs in generative AI, safety, and personalization – and Pixley has cracked it.

The market opportunity is massive. Families already spend billions on streaming and educational media, but the content is one-size-fits-all. By giving kids a true voice in what they watch, while giving parents control, Pixley makes early education personal, fun, and effective.

We are college dropouts that have been building together for years, winning several hackathons and working with video gen along the way. We built Pixley after we saw the flood of low-quality, algorithmic AI content and knew that kids and parents deserved better.

We save data centers millions in insurance premiums and SLA violations by increasing the frequency of inspection and maintenance while reducing the time it takes to triage and address failures.

  Voice AI for booking freight

LONG DESCRIPTION:
  Lanesurf helps freight brokers book shipments with vetted carriers at the best prices by negotiating rates across multiple calls in parallel.

Our self-improving voice AI stack is built for the messy reality of logistics - noisy calls, compliance checks, constant exceptions and turns them into faster bookings at better margins.

With each booking, the AI learns from aggregated, anonymized lane and pricing data. As more customers use Lanesurf, this learning compounds, driving faster bookings at the best prices and powering a voice-driven freight marketplace.

SHORT DESCRIPTION:
  AI for Field Inspection Reports

LONG DESCRIPTION:
  Opusense AI automates field report writing for construction field inspectors. Instead of typing up notes at the end of the day, inspectors can now walk a site, speak observations aloud, snap photos, and let our AI assistant generate a detailed, organized report on-site and in real time.

Combined, the founding team has over 15 years in the construction industry. Writing up these field reports used to take up at least 20% of the week. With Opusense, we cut that time by 5x. Our team combines deep construction experience with technical expertise, Roya has a PhD in civil engineering, and Michael has worked at multiple construction tech startups.

Why hasn’t this been done before? Construction is slow to adopt new tech, and reporting is messy, photos, voice notes, and field notes all live in silos. Turning that into a clear, structured report requires real insight into how inspectors work and what clients need. Only now, with advances in AI, can we process unstructured data adequately to generate high-quality reports in real time.

The opportunity is massive. Every inspection firm and contractor is struggling with documentation. Manual reports slow them down, create inconsistencies, and delay handoffs. We believe AI can do this better, and Opusense is proving it.
