  • Is Hiring: False

SHORT DESCRIPTION:
  AI agent that handles all of your B2B content needs

LONG DESCRIPTION:
  Imagine AI is a task-based agentic AI that becomes your company's Head of Content. For B2B service firms, this means turning your partners' expertise into a pipeline-generating machine. Instead of executives spending 8+ hours a week trying to write posts, our AI performs deep research to build a 100-page persona, captures their authentic voice, and automates content that books meetings at named accounts.

Our college-dropout, second-time founding team includes Sky Yang (raised $150M as UCSD's youngest Student Body President) and Neo Lee (a Berkeley Math/AI researcher). The idea for Imagine AI came after a YC partner told us directly: founders and partners at B2B firms are experts at their jobs, but they consistently struggle to turn that expertise into effective marketing that drives revenue.

We launched just 8 weeks ago and have already reached $14k in revenue from 30 paying users, including forward-thinking firms like Conduit (YC '24). The demand is clear, with a 250+ person waitlist. The results are even clearer: one of our first users recently landed a $5M deal that originated from a single post our AI created.

We are displacing the expensive, low-ROI agency model by building the content OS for every LinkedIn-native B2B company. 

To see how we automate your pipeline, book a demo at https://calendar.notion.so/meet/skyyang333/ghost

  We run and deploy code your AI wrote

LONG DESCRIPTION:
  Ben and Jacob met in Calculus class in 10th grade, and tried founding a startup in high school — it didn’t go anywhere.

During high school, Ben lead the frontend team for the World Health Organization’s COVID-19 App Team.

After high school, Jacob went to Apple and Ben went to college. When there was an opening on his team, Jacob had Ben apply, and Ben left UChicago to go work at Apple.

They spent about 2 years at Apple as Senior Engineers in the Conversational Engineering Department, before leaving to found Freestyle.

Freestyle is directly inspired by what they saw as their failures of the tech they worked with at Apple.

SHORT DESCRIPTION:
  Billing infrastructure for AI

LONG DESCRIPTION:
  Autumn is open-source infrastructure over Stripe that allows AI startups to build their pricing plans quickly, and flexibly. We act as your app's DB and manage who's paying for what, track usage and manage customer feature access.

YC companies use us because we make it easy to handle common pricing models like usage-based, credits, subscriptions, rollovers and more in 3 functions and no webhooks. 

As you scale, you get reliable billing, that you can change however you want without wrangling code (we handle versioning, migrations etc), and manage custom pricing too. Everything you could down the line (credits, multiple subscription groups, rollovers, referral program, usage analytics, centralized team billing etc), you can drop in at any point.
