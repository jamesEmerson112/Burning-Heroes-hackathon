        "description": "We are hiring a Senior AI Engineer to own our AI’s ability to understand, respond to, and act on user queries from the ground up. This is not a research role or a “prompt tinkering” side project. You will build agentic LLM systems that can connect to external tools and APIs, structure their reasoning, and execute actions reliably.\nYou’ll be hands-on with prompt engineering, LLM frameworks, and agent design, while also applying software engineering rigor to make these systems stable, scalable, and useful. The right candidate moves fast, learns new methods as the field shifts, and always drives toward business outcomes, not demos or academic novelty.\nWe don’t believe in overwork or equating hours with outcomes. What matters is results tied to business and customer outcomes—nothing else.\nThis is a hybrid role, 3–4 days per week in-office in Mission Viejo.\nWhat You’ll Do\nDesign and implement LLM-powered agents that can reason, decide, and act via connected APIs, databases, and external systems.\nOwn the prompting, fine-tuning, and orchestration that make these systems intelligent and usable.\nApply strong engineering principles (modularity, testing, observability) so the AI’s actions are reliable in production.\nContinuously scan the landscape for new frameworks, libraries, and techniques, and integrate what’s useful.\nCollaborate with product and leadership to ensure progress is tied directly to business results.\nDocument decisions and trade-offs, ensuring clarity for current and future teammates.\nProven ability to deliver usable systems under startup constraints: full ownership of outcomes, small teams, fast pivots, and delivering usable systems with limited resources.\nWork in a modified agile framework based on your direct input (no dogma or purist approach) with daily standups and project management coordinated between you, the COO, and two other engineers (frontend and backend).\nTake strategic and product guidance from a cofounder who will be in-office with you in Orange County. The COO supports your growth and ensures you have what you need to succeed, while the cofounders focus on product excellence\nYou'll occasionally join customer calls to hear feedback and problems directly from users.\nMust-Haves\nStrong, validated expertise in software engineering with expertise shipping production systems from beginning to end.\nDeep hands-on work with LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, open-source stacks, LangChain/LlamaIndex/transformers, etc.) and expertise in building agents using them.\nExperience building multi-step, tool-using agents that act across varied systems, not just single-action chatbots\nProven ability to pick up new technologies quickly and apply them pragmatically.\nAbility to turn messy, ambiguous problems into solvable projects, with clear scoping, regular updates, and visible progress for stakeholders\nExcellent communication: clearly defines projects, can explain assumptions, trade-offs, and progress clearly.\nWhat We Value\nWe hire for mental models, not buzzwords. The right candidate will embody:\nBias to Progress\n→ Keeps work moving, persistent in ambiguity, avoids getting stuck.\nBusiness Results First\n→ Prioritizes impact over complexity, identity, or “cool tech.”\nSimplicity Bias\n→ Builds the leanest path to the outcome, avoids overbuilding.\nOwnership\n→ Takes responsibility, integrates feedback, doesn’t deflect blame.\nAdaptability\n→ Learns new tools fast, evolves methods as the field shifts.\nCollaborative Pragmatism\n→ Can disagree respectfully, align quickly, and execute.\nNice-to-Haves\nExperience with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) or vector DBs.\nExposure to evaluation frameworks for LLMs to ensure reliability scoring and reduce hallucinations.\nExperience in startups or lean environments where speed and iteration matter.\nCompensation and Growth\n$150,000 + Equity\nHealth, Dental and Vision Insurance + Dependents\nFour Weeks Paid Time Off (We try to encourage you to take time off)\nInterview Process\nAt Humoniq, we design hiring to be fair, predictive, and respectful of your time. You’ll have the chance to show what you can do on your own terms, choosing when and where, so you’re able to perform at your best.\nThe data is clear:\nresumes are one of the weakest predictors of job performance\n(Hunter & Schmidt’s meta-analysis, ~0.1–0.2 correlation). They’re noisy, biased toward pedigree, and reward formatting skills.\nThat’s why we combine structured interviews with research-backed assessments.\nFairness:\nInterviews can sometimes reward confidence over skill. Assessments give every candidate the same chance to show their abilities, leveling the playing field.\nEffectiveness:\nDecades of studies show assessments are stronger predictors of job success than interviews alone. They help us focus on real skills, not just first impressions.\nFor You:\nThis means you won’t be judged on resume, background, accent, or personality quirks, but on what really matters is your ability to do the work.\nOur entire process will take less than 8 hours, and will not require any ‘at home’ assessment from you. There will be an in person component as part of the last interview.",

Our platform starts with intelligent bookkeeping: we connect all their financial accounts, use AI to automatically categorize income and expenses, and assess their potential tax deductibility, giving creators a clear picture of their business finances and tax preparedness. This core solution, already actively used for expense management and tax Q&A, is the first step. We will rapidly expand to automate quarterly tax filing and payments, then provide integrated tools for S-corp formation and management, payroll, and benefits: truly becoming the 'Rippling for content creators.' Our success means creators save more money, reduce administrative burdens, and can confidently focus on their craft and growth within the creator economy.",

They choose the academic or moral lesson each story teaches, making screen time both safe and educational. For the first time, children and parents have complete control of the media they consume.\r\n\nWe’re harnessing brand-new video gen technology that’s set to revolutionize how the world creates and learns. Generating animated, narrative-consistent content from a child’s input in real time demands breakthroughs in generative AI, safety, and personalization – and Pixley has cracked it.\r\n\nThe market opportunity is massive. Families already spend billions on streaming and educational media, but the content is one-size-fits-all. By giving kids a true voice in what they watch, while giving parents control, Pixley makes early education personal, fun, and effective.\r\n\nWe are college dropouts that have been building together for years, winning several hackathons and working with video gen along the way. We built Pixley after we saw the flood of low-quality, algorithmic AI content and knew that kids and parents deserved better.",

Instead of typing up notes at the end of the day, inspectors can now walk a site, speak observations aloud, snap photos, and let our AI assistant generate a detailed, organized report on-site and in real time.\r\n\nCombined, the founding team has over 15 years in the construction industry. Writing up these field reports used to take up at least 20% of the week. With Opusense, we cut that time by 5x. Our team combines deep construction experience with technical expertise, Roya has a PhD in civil engineering, and Michael has worked at multiple construction tech startups.\r\n\nWhy hasn’t this been done before? Construction is slow to adopt new tech, and reporting is messy, photos, voice notes, and field notes all live in silos. Turning that into a clear, structured report requires real insight into how inspectors work and what clients need. Only now, with advances in AI, can we process unstructured data adequately to generate high-quality reports in real time.\r\n\nThe opportunity is massive. Every inspection firm and contractor is struggling with documentation. Manual reports slow them down, create inconsistencies, and delay handoffs. We believe AI can do this better, and Opusense is proving it.",

Unfortunately we cannot support visa sponsorship\nJDs are always too long - we prefer to chat in person! However, here are the essentials:\nAt SAMMY Labs we are building a new software paradigm that will one day [we hope] be as ubiquitous as having a git repo! SAMMY is live, AI-powered graph of every possible click path in our customers software, enabling us to automatically generate personalized onboarding, walkthroughs, and documentation that update instantly - but that's just the start. Check out\nwww.sammylabs.com\nfor more info.\nCompany status:\nWe've just completed YCombinator and raised a very healthy seed round from T1 investors and Angels.\nTop 5 launch in the batch! (\nhttps://www.ycombinator.com/launches/Mqy-sammy-labs-ai-customer-success-agents-your-users-delighted\n)\nIn just 3 months we have 10+ enterprise customers from series A all the way to decacorns!\nThe role/what we are looking for:\nWe are all builders and there's a lot to build! We love folks who build in their spare time so show us the cool stuff you have made. Practically, you're a scrappy dev and happy to hop on youtube/deep research to learn new things\nIdeally 2+ years experience in a software engineer role (new grads welcome but you need to have things you have personally built). We don't care what university you went to or where you've worked prior, the main thing is you learn fast.\nThis is a great role for someone who wants to learn the inner-workings of an extremely fast growing startup to one day take the plunge of your own\nSkills we favour but aren't a requirement, experience in/with:\nNextjs\nPython\nAWS infra\nLangchain/langgraph\nfastapi\nWait so it's a full-stack role? Sort of... If you're purely front-end or backend you need to show you are a beast at one of them - how you show us is up to you\nPay & Equity\nNot being transparent with pay & equity sucks, we know. Which is why there is no upper limit to either, come to us with an offer - if you think you're a 150k/yr dev just tell us why, and if we agree - that salary is yours. Same with equity.\nCulture & Team\nWe have overwhelming demand right now, we've had to move new customers to a waitlist... which means we work super hard. If you're past the late nights stage of your career that's totally understandable! We are all laser focused on building an entirely new software paradigm and that should excite you too!\nEveryone is autonomous, if you prefer to have a checklist of things to do then perhaps SAMMY isnt for you.
